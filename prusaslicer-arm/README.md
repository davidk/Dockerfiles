# prusaslicer-arm

This directory contains a Dockerfile to assist in building PrusaSlicer on ARM. Directly executing the Dockerfile works on a Raspberry Pi 4.

The Dockerfile does not currently build a PrusaSlicer build that can be run (similar to [docker-slic3r-prusa3d](https://github.com/davidk/docker-slic3r-prusa3d)).
