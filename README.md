# Dockerfiles

A collection of Dockerfiles for building various projects. These are manually tested at release, but things might change between then and when they're pulled down for use. So definitely file pull requests if that happens!

### Structure

This is loosely enforced, but the arrangement is usually a combination of: `github_username/project`. If it builds a project within a project, the naming can be a bit more creative.

Every Dockerfile header contains the instructions to build the Dockerfile, so definitely look there!
